# Polygamo Release v1.0.17i10.alpha

Polygamo is a language compiler and player for general games.

This is the initial release, and the status is alpha. 
It all works, there are no known bugs, but there is much yet to do.

The binary is a Unity build for desktop Windows. 
There is no installer. 
Simply unzip the release and run the executable. 

The release includes a small selection of games as samples.
At present the only way to create your own games is to rebuild from source.
