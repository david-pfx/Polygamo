(game
  (title "Tic-Tac-Toe")
  (description "The game is played on a 3 by 3 grid between players X and O.
    Player X goes first. Each player alternately drops a man in an empty square.
    The game is won if either side gets three in a row, horizontally,
    vertically, or diagonally. Otherwise it's a draw.")
  (history "Tic-Tac-Toe is an old game and is often played when there are
    no moveable pieces available, by drawing or carving marks.
    It is played all over the world under various names, such as 'Noughts and Crosses' in
    England.")
  (strategy "With perfect play, Tic-Tac-Toe is a draw. First player has the 
    advantage, provided the first move is centre or corner. Most won games are achieved
    by leaving two open twos that cannot both be blocked.")
